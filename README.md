Botnak
======

This is the development branch for Botnak 2 Episode 2, which has a while to go before being 100% polished and released.

Botnak is a Java-based IRC chat client with bot capabilities and a focus on Twitch.tv streams.

#Download:
The latest (pre-compiled) build can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/vbi96scjutlrgzx/Botnak.jar

Keep in mind, this does not mean that Botnak is a final product, but the version in the link above is much more ahead than the master branch. However, this implies multiple changes, some of which may require additional research to have Botnak work completely. It is only recommended to download this if you wish to test Botnak and report bugs.

Speaking of reporting bugs, if you come across an issue, simply open a New Issue in the issues tab! I am using that tab to track progress of Episode 2, so an issue there would be the best place to put it. If you don't wish to publicly report the issue, go ahead and PM me on twitch, at http://twitch.tv/gocnak .

You will need the latest version of Java 7 to run Botnak.

A full example list of commands and such can be found at http://bit.ly/1366RwM.
