Botnak
======

A Java-based IRC chat client with bot capabilities and a focus on Twitch.tv streams.

A full example list of commands and such can be found at http://bit.ly/1366RwM

Some useful tips:

SET THE DEFAULT DIRECTORIES: Click the "Defaults Settings..." button in the main GUI and set the default face and sound to a Dropbox directory, which is recommended so that you can invite other people to it and they can add faces/sounds while you stream.

FILE SIZES/LENGTH: Try to keep faces below 26 px in height, with size 18 font it fits well enough. Sound files should not be any longer than 5 seconds unless a special case.
