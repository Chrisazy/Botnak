You need the latest Java version in order to run it.\r\n\r\nA full example list of commands and such can be found at http://bit.ly/1366RwM.\r\n\r\nSome useful pieces of advice:\r\n\r\n#IN YO FACE:\r\nBotnak supports all Twitch faces, including Subscriber faces. He downloads them and puts them in the \"Botnak/Face/\" folder on a separate thread. Faces will not work until he's done so, and he will print out \"Done downloading faces.\" in the panel. See: http://puu.sh/40H6D.png\r\n\r\n#YOU NEED STANDARDS:\r\nClick the \"Settings\" button in the main GUI and set the Default Face and Sound directories to a Dropbox directory, which is recommended so that you can invite other people to it and they can add faces/sounds while you stream.\r\n\r\n#SIZE MATTERS:\r\nFaces are automatically scaled to 26 pixels in height when downloaded, and also scaled based on font size. Sound files should not be any longer than 5 seconds unless they're a special case.\r\n\r\n#AND YOUR FRIENDS, TOO:\r\nBotnak supports other channels. Each channel has its own tab, and it is wise to only join a few channels at a time.\r\n\r\n#KEEPIN' IT CLEAN:\r\nBotnak is able to delete chat history (lines not on screen) after a specified number of lines have been logged. The minimum clear int is 40 lines, with no maximum. You can set this value in the Settings GUI.\r\n\r\n#FOR THE RECORD...\r\nBotnak also supports logging the session's chats to file. If selected, Botnak will print the chats to text files in Botnak/Logs/ under the folder session#-dd-mm-yy . If you also have the chat cleared option enabled, don't worry, as Botnak logs the cleared text to file before deleting it.\r\n\r\n#UP TO DATE:\r\nBotnak automatically checks to see if there's a new version available and lets you know!\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\nJSON Library for making Twitch parsing easier - https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-java\r\n\r\nJTattoo for making Botnak look pretty - http://www.jtattoo.net/\r\n\r\nScalr API for Image Scaling - https://github.com/thebuzzmedia/imgscalr/\r\n\r\nPircbot API for giving me headaches - http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php\r\n\r\nDr. Kegel from my Twitch chat for fixing them - http://www.twitch.tv/dr_kegel\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
