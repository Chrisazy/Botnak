2.11

Added:
* Crude ban/clearing of the chat detection
* A new and improved User and Channel system for fixing the
ConcurrentExceptions, and to aid the Subscriber detection
in the future.

Hotfix:
* Fixed the keyword color parsing.
* Commands now just reset after being called, instead
of the horrible "intelligent resetting" I had.
