2.2

Added:
* Subscriber icons support
* A click-enabled popup menu for usernames!
It has varying options, depending on the current situation
(if you're mod or broadcaster, if the user is already mod, etc):
    -> Ban user
    -> Timeout user
    -> Mod user
    -> Un-mod user
    -> Go to user's channel
* The bans/timeouts are now on a queue, and will update with
who has been banned and how many times every 5 seconds, in an
intelligent manner (if the user is in the chat or not).

Fixed:
* Fixed the /me messages having a ':' in them.
* Internal fixes/optimizations including making some file movements,
as well as making individual listeners, etc.

To come:
* FrankerFaceZ support
